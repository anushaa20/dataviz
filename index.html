    <h3>
      Exploring the Solar Potential of Leading Electricity Producers and the Future of Solar Power in India
    </h3>

    <br>
      <p>Electricity production is a crucial development metric, reflecting a country’s economic growth, infrastructure, and technological capabilities. Access to clean and affordable electricity is equally important. It supports modern amenities, health, education, and economic opportunities while reducing environmental pollution. Transitioning to renewable energy, is essential for balancing development with environmental sustainability and ensuring long-term energy security.

        <br>
        <br>
        are the top countries in terms of electricity production. However, they are also the top consumers. These 5 countries alone contribute to around 60% of the total world consumption.</p>

      <p>This <a href= "https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix" target="_blank">electricity mix</a> highlights our current significant reliance on coal, natural gas, and crude oil. This dependence due to their high carbon emissions is unsustainable and poses severe health and environmental risks. For both human health and climate change, the priority is to move away from fossil fuels. 
      <br>
      In recent years, the world has increasingly turned its focus towards solar energy as a crucial solution for sustainable development. This shift is driven by its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease energy costs, and enhance energy security. As technology advances and costs continue to fall, solar energy is becoming an increasingly viable option for countries aiming to achieve sustainable and resilient energy systems.

      <p>The United Nations' 7th Sustainable Development Goal highlights the need for clean and affordable energy for all. By 2030, the United Nations aims to enhance international cooperation for access to clean energy research and technology, including solar power. This plan promotes investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology, advancing a sustainable energy future for all. Solar-powered electricity generation is crucial for this transition.
      <br>
      <br>
      The World Bank released PV potential values for each country demonstrating the significant role solar energy can play, guiding investments and policies to harness this inexhaustible renewable resource.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>What is Solar PV potential?</h2>
      <p>‘Solar PV Potential’ refers to the amount of solar energy that can be converted into electricity by photovoltaic (PV) systems over a specific area and time, typically measured in kilowatt-hours per square meter per day (kWh/m²/day). This metric indicates a location's capacity to generate electricity from sunlight, considering factors like solar irradiance and weather conditions.

      <p>From these charts, we can see that countries with larger land areas tend to have a higher total PV potential, simply because they have more space to capture sunlight. However, not all countries with high PV potential per square meter have significant total potential due to their smaller landmass.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's also important to consider factors like GDP, per capita energy requirements, per capita consumption, and access to infrastructure, as these play crucial roles in how effectively a country can utilize its solar energy potential. In summary, while some countries have excellent solar energy potential per square meter, their actual ability to harness this energy depends on a combination of land area and various economic and infrastructural factors.

        But, from a global perspective,<strong> Russia, USA, Brazil, Australia, China, Canada, India, Algeria, Argentina, and Kazakhstan</strong> are the top 10 drivers in this solar energy race with their PV potential values as:
        <ol>
          <li>Australia: 454 billion units </li>
          <li>Brazil: 460 billion units</li>
          <li>Canada: 379 billion units</li>
          <li>China: 432 billion units</li>
          <li>India: 168 billion units</li>
          <li>Russia: 598 billion units</li>
          <li>United States: 476 billion units</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="rounded-box">
        <span style= "font-size: 24px;"><strong>One kilowatt-hour (1 kWh)</strong></span>
          <br>
          <br>
          is equivalent to a power of 1 kW being used for 1 hour
          <br>i.e. light a 60W incandescent bulb for ~16 hours
      </div>
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Now, in India, an average household consumes 30kWh of electricity daily (considering an average. Indian family with 5 members).
<br>
      This means, 
      <br>
      <br>
      Number of households that can be supplied energy in a day = 167650413000 kWh/ 30kWh = 5,588,347,100 households
      <br>
      <br>
      I.e. the daily PV power potential of 167,650,413,000 kWh could supply the energy needs of approximately 5.6 billion households for one day.
      <br>
      <strong>*However, the amount of electricity a household uses can vary depending on the types and quantities of appliances used, with urban households using more electricity as compared to rural households.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      But, India has a population of about 1.4 billion people.
      <br>
      <br>
      Number of Households in India =  1.4 billion people/ 5 people per household = 280 million households
      <br>
      <br>
      This means, with only one day potential India can supply energy to 20 times the number of households in India for one day.
      <br>
      <br>
      Total Daily Consumption = 280 million households×30 kWh per household = 8,400 million kWh = 8,400,000,000 kWh
      <br>
      <br>
      Number of Days = 167,650,413,000 kWh/ 8,400,000,000 kWh per day ​≈19.96 days
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>So, with the PV potential of just one day, India can supply energy to each of its households for approximately 20 days.</strong>
